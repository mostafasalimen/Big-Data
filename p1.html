<li>big data is a mixture of organized, semistructured, and unstructured data gathered by companies that can be used for intelligence purposes and used in machine learning programs, predictive analysis, and other advanced analytics applications</li>
<li>Big data processing and storing systems have become a common component of organizations data management architectures. The 3Vs often characterize big data: the large volume of data in many environments, the wide variety of data types stored in big data systems, and the speed at which the data is generated, collected, and processed</li>
<li>Doug Laney first identified these characteristics, then an analyst at Meta Group Inc., in 2001; they were further popularized by Gartner after it acquired Meta Group in 2005. More recently, several additional Vs have been added to various big data descriptions including veracity, value and variability</li>
