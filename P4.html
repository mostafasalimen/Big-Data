<li>Structured data: is used, in an ordered manner, to refer to data already stored in databases. It accounts for around 20% of all existing data and is most used in programming and computer-related activities.There are two sources of structured data- machines and humans. All the data received from sensors, weblogs and financial systems are classified as data generated by machines. These include medical devices, GPS data, usage statistics data captured by servers and applications, and the enormous amount of data typically moving through trading platforms, to name a few</li>
<li>Unstructured data:Although structured data remains in conventional row-column tables, unstructured data is the reverse-in storage they do not have a simple format. The rest of the data created for unstructured big data, about 80 per cent of the total account.Most of the data a human experiences belong to this group- and until recently, there was nothing to do with it but to archive or manually evaluate it.Also, unstructured data is classified into machine-generated or human-generated data based on their source. All the satellite images are taken from machine-generated data.the scientific data from various experiments and radar data captured by various facets of technology</li>
<li>Semi-structured data:
The line between unstructured data and semi-structured data has always been unclear since most of the semi-structured data appear to be unstructured at a glance. Information that is not in the traditional database format as structured data, but contains some organizational properties which make it easier to process, are included in semi-structured data. For example, NoSQL documents are considered to be semi-structured, since they contain keywords that can be used to process the document easily</li>
